# BonziWORLD 2+

**This bonziworld respository houses the source code to BonziWORLD 2+.**
<br>
The source code has been made public because I would like to move on from this project and work on something else. Since it's just been sitting here collecting dust, I figured I should make this public. Who knows, maybe somebody will find this useful.
<br><br>
## What is this?
BonziWORLD 2+ is a fork of BonziWORLD 2 (a replica itself, not just the original).
<br><br>
## What features make this different than BonziWORLD 2?
Some changes which make this stand out from the standard code by [heyjoeway](https://github.com/heyjoeway/BonziWORLD) originally, and the standard code by just myself:
- New BonziBUDDY color sprites and others.
- /image, /audio & /video allows you to post media to a chat room.
- A handful of new emotes
